ANSIBLE ASSIGNMENT-1

UserManager:

1. Create a group:
   
   ansible server1 -m group -a "name=team1"




2. Add the user Nitish to the team1 group and create the home directory:

   ansible server1 -m user -a "name=Nitish group=team1 createhome=yes"


3. Ensure the user Nitish has read, write, and execute access to the home directory:

   ansible server1 -m file -a "path=/home/Nitish owner=Nitish group=team1 mode=0755"


4. Ensure that all users of the same team have read and execute access to the home directory of fellow team members:

   # For the 'team' directory

   ansible server1 -m file -a "path=/home/Nitish/team owner=Nitish group=team1 mode=0770 state=directory"

   # For the 'ninja' directory

   ansible server1 -m file -a "path=/home/Nitish/ninja owner=Nitish group=team1 mode=0777 state=directory"


These ad hoc commands perform the same tasks as the tasks defined in your Ansible playbook but are executed individually on the command line.
